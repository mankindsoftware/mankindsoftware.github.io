<p>I tend to think of a Promise as an IOU that Angular hands me. No&#8230;  more as an empty box for data that Angular has yet to retrieve. Often the data must be retrieved from the Internet, or a database, or some other place, all too far away in time &#8212;  for a snappy, no-lag UI/X that people expect nowadays &#8212; to rely on.</p>
<p>In Angular, I don&#8217;t need the data before I start building a view with it.  I  use its empty-box Promise in stead.</p>
<p>The thing is,  it is Angular that first hands me the empty Promise box in response to, say, a database request.</p>
<p>I choose, at some point in my program, to hand the Promise box, unopened, back to Angular to build a web page screen around the boxes contents.</p>
<p>It is Angular that builds the page, with everything but the data. It is Angular that quietly stuffs the data in the Promise box when it finally gets the real thing. And  it is Angular that rather dramatically pulls the true data out of  the box and pops it on the screen.</p>
<p>I never had to look in the box.</p>
<p>Promises work great and can remain forever unseen under the covers of the Angular framework.  Being able to move on in the programming sequence and create your typical CRUD lists and forms based on objects as-yet unrealized feels good for me as UI programmer. It feels good for me and it feels good for the user. It just flows.</p>
<p>But I want to provide an experience that exceeds the typical CRUD displays. And this may mean working with the real data of the promises.</p>
<p>I want to know when the actual data arrives, just as Angular does behind the scenes.  To do this, I take the Promise into my own hands.  I get $promise from the resource object and call the &#8220;$promise.then&#8221;  method, passing in my own call-back function for the promise system to call back if and when it retrieves the data successfully. As below, I make it clear that  I want my data mining task  to be launched with the true data in the call below, and I move on to complete other event set-ups.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: javascript; gutter: false\">resource.$promise.then(function(trueData){
  // No more promises.
  dataMine(trueData);
}</pre>
<p>And then I wait. I wait for the &#8216;then&#8217;.  And when the &#8216;then&#8217; data arrives, I move on. In real time.  Spawning a task that is based on that data.</p>
<p>In my own practice,  there is always an end to this chain of Futures.</p>
<p>But I got to thinking, how nice would it be for an entire framework or language to use only promises, from end to end? My technique of  triggering  certain tasks only when the real data arrives wouldn&#8217;t make sense.  I would never need to wait; I would assume I have a promise. I would blithely move forward, deeper in the code, spawning each task based on a promise, carrying this on to the program&#8217;s nether end.</p>
<p>It would be Promises, all the way down.</p>
<p>So then, why can&#8217;t I do that now? With what I&#8217;ve got? Is this kiting the future?</p>
<p>Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

<p>Needing a SOAP client, to run on the Bitnami Node.js Stack on Amazon, I could not find a mature and easy-to-use JavaScript library. I chose to use Python and <a title=\"Suds: Python SOAP Client\" href=\"https://fedorahosted.org/suds/\" target=\"_blank\">Suds</a>.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to find Python 2.7 already installed with the stack.  But after installing Suds and trying to run some scripts developed on a Windows platform, I got the &#8220;SAXReaderNotAvailable&#8221; error:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: bash; gutter: false\">raise SAXReaderNotAvailable(&quot;No parsers found&quot;, None)

<p>Through the usual Google-search-led trial-and-error process I found the following fix: directly install PyXML.  (Thanks to <a title=\"TheRosiek.com\" href=\"http://TheRosiek.com\" target=\"_blank\">TheRosiek.com</a>.)</p>

cd PyXML-0.8.4
python setup.py install</pre>
<p>A &#8220;PyXML &#8221; Google search suggests that it has been discontinued for more than half a decade, but it is being updated and it is what is working for me right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear about any alternatives to PyXML.</p>

<p>The computer is the only machine in history to be able to reverse time.  Other machines can mow, shred, hoe, plant, reap, mold, lathe, copy, stitch, glue.  But none can Undo. And Undo is a transformative distinction.</p>
<p>Undo allows you to start over again.  To remove regrets. To feel and retain the pains and joys from a discarded future and to do it differently, hopefully better, again. Editors, spreadsheets, simulations; their power lies in the Undo.</p>
<p>Undo affords you a new human experience.  It moves the intellectual exercise of &#8220;what-if&#8221; into the gut-feeling of &#8220;should-have&#8221;. Undo lets you be a continuously enriched component of the process, providing critical management and business intelligence the computer can not yet attain.</p>
<p>Undo has much to offer data visualization. You are still better at seeing visual patterns than the computer is, but there is still much to be done in this field in terms of time-sequence loops and Undo.</p>
<p>A studied use of Undo will raise user interface design into the more compelling stratum of user experience design.</p>

<p>Executive Summary:  Iomega Home Media NAS drives may have an XFS file corruption that results in existing files not being listed in a file browser. The xfs_repair command with forced Log Zeroing (-L option)  can fix this.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Iomega Home Media NAS seemed to have lost my files. I could see the original  folder &#8220;shares&#8221; in the file browser, but these folders were empty.</p>
<p>This was the second time this breakdown occurred. The first time I didn&#8217;t care, as I had backup and I could not easily find a working solution from my web search.  But the second time it happened, I decided to investigate the cause and the fix.</p>
<p>The following is the working sequence I took to correct the problem, which turned out to be file-corruption on the NAS device.</p>
<p><span id=\"more-469\"></span></p>
<p>1. Home Media Web UI</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Home Media web UI, went to Home &#8211; Disk.</li>
<li>I noted that there was a lot of disk space taken, which could only be true if  the files were still there.</li>
<li> I pressed the disk repair button. This did not fix my problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Web Search for Specific Problem</p>
<ul>
<li>People who actually lost the share folders as well were told to to go to the device&#8217;s web graphical user interface and recreate the folder with the same name and the files will reappear. I experimented with deleting a minor folder I had created previously myself,  and  then recreating it.  No good.</li>
<li>Note that some providers of file recovery software are the pros of viral marketing con jobs. Doing a web search for  &#8220;I lost my hard drive files I&#8217;m desperate What do I do?&#8221; often brings you to one of pages and pages of authentic-looking  forums. One member-slash-viral-infector writes &#8220;I had the same problem and it was fixed by the SuperRecover program at SuperRecover.com.&#8221;  A cohort of the infector  says, &#8220;Thanks for the advice. It worked! It was well worth the $80 I spent.&#8221;  You buy the software and it doesn&#8217;t work for you. You&#8217;ve been scammed and you are still desperate for a real solution.</li>
<li>Concerning non-NAS hard-drives, I have a single word of advice for someone dealing with a hard-drive failure on his or her Windows PC: &#8220;<a title=\"Knoppix\" href=\"http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">Knoppix</a>&#8220;. Boot your PC from the Knoppix CD and you have a linux operating system that does an end-run around the Window&#8217;s system so that you can retrieve your files and move them somewhere safer.</li>
<li>The legitimate Iomega forums always suggest to recreate the folder, and that the files will magically reappear. If the files don&#8217;t reappear, the form leaders are strangely mute. That is because the solution requires breaking into and working with the Home Media operating system directly. This likely voids the Iomega warranty. (e.g. http://www.iomegasupportforums.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=58667&amp;highlight=missing).</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Breaking into the Home Media NAS.</p>
<ul>
<li>This NAS is a computer, running the Linux operating system. Enable telnet and root access on the device. <a title=\"NAS Central: Home Media\" href=\"http://iomega.nas-central.org/wiki/Category:Home_Media\" target=\"_blank\">Nas-central.org</a> has the code to do it, specifically at  <a title=\"NAS Central\" href=\"http://iomega.nas-central.org/wiki/Home_Media_Enable_Telnet_And_Root_Access\" target=\"_blank\">http://iomega.nas-central.org/wiki/Home_Media_Enable_Telnet_And_Root_Access</a>.</li>
<li>I downloaded &#8220;enable_telnet.tgz (4).encrypted&#8221; from nas-central.org and uploaded the file as-is to the the device through its web UI at System &#8211; Sytem Tasks &#8211; Firmware Upgrade.</li>
<li>I telnet-ed into my Home Media with the nascentral name and password provided in the documentaion. Wow, I was inside my box and in the familiar terrain of Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Finding the Problem Source: XFS File Corruption</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;share&#8221; folders can be found under the<span style=\"color: #008000;\"> &#8220;nethdd&#8221;</span> folder.  Doing a listing (&#8220;ls -las&#8221;) of the root directory showed something like</li>
</ul>
<pre class=\"brush: shell; gutter: false\"># ?????????? ? ?      ?          ?                ? nethdd</pre>
<ul>
<li><a title=\"Question Marks\" href=\"http://www.xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_Why_some_files_of_my_filesystem_shows_as_.22.3F.3F.3F.3F.3F.3F.3F.3F.3F.3F_.3F_.3F_.3F_.3F_.3F_filename.22_.3F\" target=\"_blank\">xfs.org</a> points the way toward this being a mounting problem.</li>
<li>Indeed, on the device, &#8220;/var/log/dmesg&#8221; shows the fact that there is file corruption, so the mount of nethdd failed:</li>
</ul>
<pre class=\"brush: shell; gutter: false\">FS internal error XFS_WANT_CORRUPTED_GOTO...</pre>
<ul>
<li>Corruption in this case may be due to the way a 32-bit machine fails to handle a 64 bit long btree pointer in the version of Linux that the Home Media device uses. See: &#8220;<a title=\"Long btree pointers are still 64 on disk.\" href=\"http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0901.2/01965.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0901.2/01965.html</a>&#8220;.</li>
<li>Additional look into logs indicated that corruption took place when automatically backing up an ISO image and some other huge single files.</li>
<li>I found the mount command parameters in &#8220;/etc/nasmon_conf.sh&#8221;:</li>
</ul>
<div>
<pre class=\"brush: shell; gutter: false\">Volume1=2,xfs,/nethdd/,&quot;/sbin/mkfs.xfs -f &quot;,&quot;-t xfs -o noatime,nobarrier</pre>
</div>
<p>5. Repair</p>
<p>First, unmount nethdd&#8217;s device  if, somehow, it is mounted.</p>
<pre class=\"brush: shell; gutter: false\">umount /dev/sda2</pre>
<p>(Update: A simple umount may not work, thus not allowing xfs_repair and showing &#8220;fatal error &#8211; couldn&#8217;t initialize XFS library&#8221;. In that case, a commenter recommended trying &#8220;umount -l /dev/sda2&#8243;, whereby xfs_repair should work.)</p>
<p>Second, repair and force Log Zeroing:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: shell; gutter: false\">xfs_repair -L /dev/sda2</pre>
<p>Third, reboot to let the normal startup process mount the nethdd filesystem:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: shell; gutter: false\">reboot</pre>
<blockquote><p><em> Executive Summary</em></p>
<p><em>Iomega Home Media NAS drives may have an XFS file corruption that results in existing files not being listed in a file browser. The xfs_repair command with forced Log Zeroing (-L option)  can fix this.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of firing-up Photoshop to change a GIF to a PNG, or to resize an image, I&#8217;ve taken to <a title=\"Blog\" href=\"http://mankind.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">online-convert.com</a>

<p>&#8216;s web site.</p>
<p>This is a great productivity tool for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio conversion</li>
<li>Video conversion</li>
<li>Image conversion</li>
<li>Document conversion</li>
<li>Ebook conversion</li>
<li>Archive conversion</li>
<li>Hash generation</li>
</ul>
<p>I can even convert and download an image from the web by specifying its URL. Too easy.</p>
<p>Note that the terms of use include &#8220;&#8230;  the Customer grants the Provider a right of use of the file, unlimited by time or space. &#8221;</p>
<p>Usually these kind of sites gather data for marketing purposes. But be wise and don&#8217;t upload files with personal information such as your credit card number.</p>
<p>Kudos to QaamGo Media UG and <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jens-bierkandt/5/1b2/934\">Jens-Peter Bierkandt</a> for this one.</p>

<p>After surveying a number of NoSQL technologies, I&#8217;ve opted to back my project with Neo4j.  It is a good fit with my world view, a world I see as a collection of amorphous objects connected by links with patterns often, as yet, undiscovered.</p>
<p>In addition, I am a very visual thinker (and used to be surprised that a lot of programmers are not), and of course graphs lend themselves very easily to visualization.</p>
<p>In terms of big data, graphs can lend a certain transparency, by virtue of adjunct visualization, to the organization of the data. Imagine what you can do with the capability of visualizing every step of data processing.</p>
<p>I believe that with data visualization, along with the modern programming techniques that Ruby and Ruby on Rails has main-streamed (e.g. declarative programming (e.g. CSS3)), a complete tool-set exists for creating truly visual software engineering and processing environments.</p>

There are JavaScript techniques to download and replace content after everything is fleshed out on the screen. That is another story.  Following are tools to get you on the path to speedy page downloads.</p>
<p>1.  Google&#8217;s <a title=\"Page Speed Online\" href=\" https://developers.google.com/pagespeed/\">Page Speed Online</a> ( <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/pagespeed/\">https://developers.google.com/pagespeed/</a>) is your quickest way to evaluate the time it takes to complete a page  is to go to and enter in the URL of the page in question. Try it on your main domain name for a first impression. This will give a score for your page, based on &#8220;best practices&#8221;, which are known and established ways of speeding up load time.</p>
<p>2. Firebug (<a title=\"Firebug\" href=\"http://getfirebug.com/\">http://getfirebug.com/</a>) is an &#8220;addon&#8221; for the Firefox web browser.  As a serious web developer, you must have Firefox &#8212; with Firebug &#8212; on your machine.  It will help you optimize your pages.  If there&#8217;s slowness from your back-end services, Firebug gives you a timeline of each downloaded element of the page, so you can start making intelligent guesses (or experiments) to determine what back-end part of your system might be slowing down the page.</p>
<p>3. YSlow (<a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/\">http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/</a>) is an addon for Firefox as well, and there is a YSlow web application for Google&#8217;s Chrome browser. It also grades your page according to best practice requirements.</p>
<p>Sidebar:</p>
<p>Best-practices have been succinctly encapsulated in  &#8220;HTML5 BoilerPlate&#8221;.  Even if you&#8217;re not designing for HTML5, it&#8217;s the best code base with which to start.  Paul Irish lives on the A-List of web development best practices and he gives a YouTube presentation of  his work at<a title=\"Paul Irish HTML5 BoilerPlate\" href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qyM37XKkmKQ\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=qyM37XKkmKQ</a>.</p>

<p>Visualization of software and processes had been so natural to me then, so much a way that I looked at my work, that I had assumed that all other programmers thought the same way. It still took me a long time to realize that very many programmers don&#8217;t &#8212; or can&#8217;t &#8212; think of software in visual terms.</p>
<p>I get excited when I see a concept explained in terms of engaging graphics, as creationix Tim Caswell has done.</p>

That is because when I engineer an architecture requiring concurrent processing, the principals of asynchronous programming always come into play.</p>
<p>My world-view comes from decades of UI coding, where the event queue is master and one must play by its rules. Making mind-blowing visual processes work simultaneously, or at least appear to, made concurrency and asynchronousity one and the same in my mind.</p>
<p>In my euphoria, I already see the ascendance of asynchronous programming design patterns (e.g. &#8220;callbacks&#8221;,&#8221; futures&#8221;,  &#8220;promises&#8221;) to the point where it&#8217;s taught in Software 101.  These patterns will in turn lead to complementary concurrency patterns.  And all will be optimized in the compiler and runtime engines.</p>
<p>Asynchronous programming is both the gateway drug and enabler for true, concurrent systems.</p>

<p>Most are too cartoonish and clunky to give credibility. Or they&#8217;re just hangings of the familiar 2D items in 3D space, although that has its merits.</p>
<p>Most of the problems with quality can be blamed on a lack of graphics processing power to date. But let&#8217;s say that is not an issue.
