<H1 CLASS=3Heading>5.1.3   DISCUSSION</H1>
<P> The artifacts and methods of design are instantiated independently. As new representations are required of the design, it is far easier to add a tile to the design folder. As new processes must be added, it is easier to classify them and associate a menu item with them. It can be said that this system is open because new objects and procedures can be added (and even tied together at the object level), without requiring the ties to be depicted at the view level. Additionally, a representation can be removed without violating any rules of sequencing. </P>
<P> An additional aspect of the Design Processor is the lack of hierarchy. All states of a design are available at once. This is an aspect of a flattened representation within the system similar to that required for 4GL processing. The availability of information such as all the representations of a design at the same level leads to an immediate understanding of the present state of the design without in-depth browsing.</P>
