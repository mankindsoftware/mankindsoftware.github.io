<H1 CLASS=4Heading>7.6.1.1   INFORMATION STORAGE</H1>
<P> In the implementation of rules, it is seen how heuristics are formalized for symbolic computation. Frames corresponding to categories and properties can be constructed so that the rules are based upon abstractions rather than values. Experiential heuristics and features become concrete as rules and frames and can be stored and reside in part of the corporate memory as data itself.</P>
<P> Tractable, storable entities are provided through the abstraction process. As data is abstracted from the continuum of reality it may be stored. As rules and category frames evolve from the data they may be formally stored. Theory, in turn can be characterized as an abstraction of the rules and categories and can be stored, albeit often implicitly in the form of applications. As has been illustrated throughout this work, one agent's abstraction is another agent's data. At all levels, these abstractions may be stored on a persistent, physical medium as external memory.</P>
<P> It has been seen that primary and secondary storage are not issues in the future development of this paradigm. However, given that information in whatever form will be brought to bear upon a number of different domains, access to it must be immediate and quick. The bottle-neck will be access times and information throughput. Computation has a fundamental dependency on computer MIPS. The presentation of information upon the screen in video or faxed form in not dependant on computation, but is still dependant on the processor speed. </P>
