<H1 CLASS=3Heading>4.1.9   EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION</H1>
<P> Although PIMES is primarily used to evaluate and assess a design, there is a recognition that the expertise captured should be available for consultation. For example, rather than indicate that a part is too thick for the material being used, the knowledge base should be able to offer the materials available for the given thickness constraint. This is the distinction between evaluation and recommendation, and each data structure should be constructed so as to be efficiently used for both.</P>
<P> Mold dimensioning is a recommendation. In this case, the number of cavities in a mold may be one, two, or four. In determining mold dimensions, 4 inches are allotted between the cavity and the edge of the mold and eight inches are allotted between the cavities themselves. Three different cavity number values satisfy the condition of one of three different rules that proceed to infer the proper height and width adjustment for the mold of concern.</P>
<P> PIMES makes recommendations in molding machine choices. Selection of machines relies on such parameters as plastic unit injection, mold tonnage requirements, mold size, and similar parameters. These parameters are calculated largely from Noodles-supplied volume and surface projection calculations. Additional information involves mold tonnage specification adjustments which depend on the plastic material being used and includes the specifications and availability of machines on the shop floor.</P>
