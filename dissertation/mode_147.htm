<H1 CLASS=2Heading>7.3   REPRESENTATION TRANSFORMATIONS</H1>
<P> Based on the semiotic characterization of the sign to concept relationships as iconic, symbolic, and indexed, it is asserted that a transformed representation can be related in a similar manner. The transformation of one representation to another can be viewed as the manipulation, substitution, and/or creation of signs. This section identifies and defines three types of transformations as <I CLASS=Body>derivation, abstraction</I>, and <I CLASS=Body>mapping</I>. In positing a representation and its transform as an object and its sign, the semiotic categories of icon, index, and symbolic signs permit a constructive analysis of how meaning is transferred through or across a transform. <A HREF="#MARKER-9-111" CLASS=Body>Figure 82</A> illustrates the relationships between a representation A and a representation B.</P>
<P>Figure 82    <A NAME=MARKER-9-111></A>The Semiotics of Transformation Relationships</P><P><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC=mo14im78.gif>
<P> The subject of examples were centered about non-manifold geometric models and transformations into alternate representations more amenable to numeric simulation operations or knowledge-based analysis. Many of the representations were graph-based with transformation accomplished by an application of rules of grammar. </P>
<P> The study of grammar is an important topic in semiotics in that it goes to the heart of linguistic structure. Chomsky's work of transformational-generative linguistics combines elements of mathematics with linguistic theory. Surface structures could be transformed without changing the deeper meaning these structures represent. Chomsky's work avoids structuralism's self-imposed limitations of descriptive behaviorism for a more flexible and prescriptive formalism. </P>
<P> Semiotics is not weakened against Chomsky's generative linguistics by its association with structuralism. Semiotics' concern is primarily of the communicative nature of symbols within a culture. Following is a taxonomy of the literal transference of information across representations.</P>
