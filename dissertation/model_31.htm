<P> In addition to a system model of the design, models of user interaction with the system can be expressed. <A HREF="#MARKER-9-18" CLASS=Body>Table 3</A> below lists and describes four evaluation modes. A constraint-base violation does not let the design wander into a problem space beyond certain constraints. The Over-the-Shoulder&nbsp;and Batch  modes allow design to occur in a more unconstrained space, and then give indication when constraints are violated or specifications are not met. </P>

<HR CLASS=Table>
<P CLASS=HTable>  Mode Action</P>
<P CLASS=HTable>  Constraint-enforced   Don't permit design violations to occur.  </P>
<P CLASS=HTable>  Over-the-Shoulder Alert user immediately during design process. </P>
<P CLASS=HTable>  Batch Allow user to explicitly submit design for evaluation. </P>
<P CLASS=HTable>  Do-Nothing Do not perform automated evaluation.</P>
<P> Unconstrained-design evaluation, whether in over-the-shoulder or batch mode, is distinguished from constraint-enforced design. The issues is not as simple as saying that the designer is either empowered by the system or controlled by the system. Both approaches have their trade-offs. Constraint-enforced systems allow for more rapid and correct prototyping while greatly limiting the options and creativity of the designer. These systems often supply a sufficient set of objects along with additional, top-level information such as functional intent with which to work.</P>
<P> Unlike the constrained systems in which information for evaluation is explicitly present, unconstrained systems usually require some abstraction and processing of the lower-level design elements. A bottom-up approach must be taken, some information must be postulated and reconstructed. </P>
